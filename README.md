# Server Maintenance Script

This script automates server maintenance tasks such as updating, upgrading, and improving security. It also allows the user to disable specific PHP versions and provides an option to reboot the server after completing the tasks.

## Features

1. **Auto Update and Upgrade**:
   - Updates the package list.
   - Upgrades installed packages.
   - Performs a distribution upgrade.
   - Removes unused packages and cleans up the package cache.

2. **Security Improvements**:
   - Enables automatic security updates using `unattended-upgrades`.
   - Configures UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) to allow SSH and enable the firewall.
   - Installs and enables `fail2ban` to prevent brute-force attacks.

3. **Disable PHP Versions**:
   - Provides a menu to select which PHP versions to disable.
   - Allows the user to disable all PHP versions at once.
   - Uses `systemctl` to stop and disable the selected PHP versions.

4. **Reboot or Exit**:
   - Prompts the user to reboot the server or exit after completing the tasks.

5. **Root Check**:
   - Ensures the script is run as root for proper execution.

## Customization

### Adding or Removing PHP Versions
To add or remove PHP versions, edit the `php_versions` associative array in the script:
```bash
declare -A php_versions=(
    ["1"]="php7.1-fpm"
    ["2"]="php7.2-fpm"
    ["3"]="php7.3-fpm"
    ["4"]="php7.4-fpm"
    ["5"]="php8.0-fpm"
